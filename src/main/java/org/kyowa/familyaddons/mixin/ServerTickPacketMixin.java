/**
 * Hypixel sends CommonPingS2CPacket with a NEGATIVE parameter on every server tick.
 * This is the real 20Hz server-tick signal used by Odin/Devonian.
 *
 * We mixin to ClientCommonNetworkHandler (the superclass) rather than
 * ClientPlayNetworkHandler, because `onPing` is declared on the superclass —
 * mixin's @Inject cannot target inherited methods on a subclass.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: onPing is called TWICE per packet arrival:
 *   1. First on the netty I/O thread → NetworkThreadUtils.forceMainThread throws
 *      OffThreadException, rescheduling the method on the main thread.
 *   2. Then on the main thread → actually processes the packet.
 *
 * If we injected at HEAD unconditionally, we'd count every tick twice and the
 * timer would run at 2x speed. Devonian's equivalent mixin injects AFTER
 * forceMainThread to side-step this; we achieve the same result by checking
 * the thread ourselves and early-returning on the netty call.
